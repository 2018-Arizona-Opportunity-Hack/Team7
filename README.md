True or False and multiple choice questions of frequently fail to collect and present both the information that the client wishes to express and the organization can be empowered by knowing. Survey Manager provides a way to connect the critical data flow between the client and organization over a mutually acceptable median; paper surveys, without requiring a tedious and expensive investment of human-hours on the organization's side.

Survey Manager empowers organizations by providing a way to perform sentiment analysis on participants responses to categorize.
